        <p>Born on the desert planet Tatooine, Darth "The Chosen One" Vader was a slave to Watto. Darth Vader, then known as Anakin Skywalker, was purchased by the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin before his untimely death. Becoming Padawan to Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, he was thrown into war at a young age and was a General in the Clone Wars alongside his Master. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, he was being groomed by Darth Sidious, also known as Chancellor Palpatine, known for his later work as Supreme Chancellor as well as Emperor Palpatine. Darth Vader emerged at the end of the Clone Wars after attacking Master Mace Windu to save the Chancellor due to believing the future Emperor could save his secret wife Padme Amidala, herself a chancellor. After an epic battle over the flowing lava of Mustafar against his former Master and father figure Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader tasted his first defeat under his new name. Near death, he was found by Emperor Palpatine who gave him an intimidating, all black suit that would be his signature style from then on. Padme unfortunately did not survive, notably after being choked by her former secret husband in a fit of rage for thinking she betrayed him. She died of sadness.</p>
